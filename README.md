# **FDM**

This repo will contain code to build a file download manager.

## STEPS
    Build the docker image using docker build command.
        Ex: docker build . -t fdm:1.0
    Run the image after building it using docker run command.
        Ex: docker run -p 8081:8081 --rm fdm:1.0

    Note: Now the server will be up and running. http://127.0.0.1:8081
